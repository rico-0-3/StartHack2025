SIX CASE STUDY




Description: The goal of this project is to create an intelligent application that assists financial experts in their daily activities. Using artificial intelligence, the application recognizes voice input from the user. When a predefined trigger word, "ciao," is spoken, the system records the user's speech and converts it into text. This text is then sent as a request to a provided API, which responds with data in JSON format. The primary information from this JSON file is extracted and sent to the web application via a Flask server. Finally, the web app generates interactive visualizations and graphs, which users can further customize to fit their individual preferences.
